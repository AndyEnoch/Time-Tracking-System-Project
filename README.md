# Time-Tracking-System-Project
A python time tracking system for calculating amount paid to workers based on the number of hours worked. This project is focused on the creation of an application to record time-tracking information of our client Nana, and allows for easy control and display of the information.

Starting the Application

The program simply requires the user to input a start and end date and time format based on the format specified in the code.  If done wrongly, the user is prompted to input the right date time format. 

Calculation

The calculation for the number of hours worked is done when the start date and time is subtracted from the end date and time. This result is then multiplied by rate of pay per hour which gives you the total pay.

Display

The total pay from the calculation is then written into an excel csv format, which displays the current date, start date and time, hours worked, end date and time, rate of pay and total pay.
